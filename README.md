# IDS-Project
**Abstract:**
In an era marked by remarkable advancements in autonomous vehicle technologies, the imperative for their seamless integration into various urban landscapes, such as India, has escalated. Focused on this pressing need, my research specifically targets the issue of malfunctioning traffic signals frequently encountered on Indian roads. This project has dual objectives: firstly, to significantly improve road safety measures, and secondly, to facilitate the seamless assimilation of autonomous vehicles into the complex and often unpredictable landscape of Indian roadways.

To achieve these ambitious goals, I've engineered a Real-Time Road Monitoring system, fortified by state-of-the-art Deep Learning algorithms. This advanced system serves a dual purpose: it detects and dynamically corrects issues pertaining to dysfunctional traffic lights. Unlike traditional road safety approaches, which are largely limited to reducing accident statistics, this system takes a more proactive role. It not only sends alerts to drivers but also captures, stores, and transmits critical data concerning the identified hazards to local government authorities for immediate, targeted remedial actions.
